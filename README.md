Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis


Overview

This project presents a complete data analytics workflow focused on analyzing customer shopping behavior. It covers data extraction, transformation, exploratory analysis, SQL-based querying, and business intelligence reporting. The objective is to derive actionable insights and communicate them effectively through dashboards, reports, and presentations.

The project demonstrates hands-on experience with Python, SQL, relational databases, and Power BI, following real-world analytics practices.


Dataset

The dataset contains customer shopping behavior data, including purchase patterns, customer attributes, and transaction details.

Data is processed and analyzed using Python before being queried in relational databases.

Cleaned data is used consistently across SQL analysis and visualization to ensure accuracy.


Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib / Seaborn

Databases: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

Query Language: SQL

Business Intelligence: Power BI

Reporting: Analytical report and presentation
